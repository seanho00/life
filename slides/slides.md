  + Teacher (Qoheleth): **assembles** wisdom
+ from what he can see **under the sun**
+ the **end of the matter**:
  + the **sum** of
  + what our **life** on earth
  + **amounts** to
+ ch12 opens with a sad + beautiful **poem**
  + we'll only read **part** of it now
  + I'll read the rest for you shortly:

Remember also your Creator <br>
in the days of your youth,

before the evil days come <br>
and the years draw near of which you will say,<br>
“I have no pleasure in them” ...

and the dust returns to the earth as it was,<br>
and the spirit returns to God who gave it.

[Ecclesiastes 12:1,7 (ESV) (p.1/3)](# "ref")

******
[8](# "ref")
Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; <br>
all is vanity.

[11](# "ref")
The words of the wise are like goads,<br>
and like nails firmly fixed <br>
are the collected sayings;<br>
they are given by one Shepherd.

[Ecclesiastes 12:8,11 (ESV) (p.2/3)](# "ref")

******
[13](# "ref")
The end of the matter; all has been heard.

Fear God and keep his commandments,<br>
for this is the whole duty of man.

[14](# "ref")
For God will bring every deed into judgment,<br>
with every secret thing, whether good or evil.
