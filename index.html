+ today: Sol's **conclusion**

  + Teacher (Qoheleth): **assembles** wisdom
+ from what he can see **under the sun**

  + what our **life** on earth

+ ch12 opens with a sad + beautiful **poem**
  + we'll only read **part** of it now
  + I'll read the rest for you shortly:

[1](# "ref")
Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth,<br>
before the evil days come

and the years draw near of which you will say,<br>
“I have no pleasure in them” ...

[Ecclesiastes 12:1 (ESV) (p.1/3)](# "ref")

******
[7](# "ref")
and the dust returns to the earth as it was,<br>
and the spirit returns to God who gave it.

[8](# "ref")
Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; all is vanity.

[11](# "ref")
The words of the wise are like goads,<br>
and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings;<br>
they are given by one Shepherd.

[Ecclesiastes 12:7-8,11 (ESV) (p.2/3)](# "ref")

******
[13](# "ref")
The end of the matter; all has been heard.<br>
Fear God and keep his commandments,<br>
for this is the whole duty of man.

[14](# "ref")
For God will bring every deed into judgment,<br>
with every secret thing, whether good or evil.

[Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 (ESV) (p.3/3)](# "ref")

>>>
+ getting **old** is no fun
  + have **wisdom** of experience
+ but also **regret** over wasted **youth**:

Just as it is appointed for man to **die once**,<br>
and after that comes **judgment**,

so **Christ**, having been **offered once** <br>
to bear the **sins** of many,

will appear a **second** time, not to deal with **sin** <br>
but to **save** those who are eagerly waiting for him.

>>>
+ **how** will we be **judged**?
+ if **no one** is righteous in God's sight
+ then our **eternal home** would be
  + eternity in the **fires** of His judgment
+ but Jesus' **death** on cross
  + has already **bourne** our sins
+ **one** sacrifice to cover
  + **all** our misdeeds past/present/future
+ first came riding a **donkey**, humble
  + as **Suffering Servant**
+ but He will **return** soon, this time
  + on a white **war horse** *(Rev19:11-16)*
  + as **Victorious King**
